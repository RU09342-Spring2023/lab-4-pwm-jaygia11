# Lab 4 part 1
This code is intended to change the brightness of two onboard LEDs on the MSP430FR2355 Dev Board using the onboard buttons. I achieved this in a very simple way. First I created a function called gpioInit, the purpose of this function is to initialize all of the pins being used, it sets both LED pins, 1.0 and 6.6, to outputs and sets them to 0. Next, it sets the button pins, 2.3 and 4.1, to inputs with a pull-up resistor and interrupts enabled. It also sets the value of both button pins to 1 so that they start on a rising edge. Next, I initialized the timers using the timerInit function. I enable both timers B0 and B1 to the SMCLK in up-mode with interrupts enabled. I also enabled the capture/ compare interrupt for both timers. Finally, I set both timers to 1KHz frequency with a 50% duty cycle.

In the code's main function, all it does is call both functions and shut off the watchdog timer. It also enables low power mode for interrupts and runs no operation to make it run forever without looping. In the interrupt service routines for both buttons, the interrupts flag is first cleared then it checks if the duty cycle is at 100%. If it is at 100% it will reset to 0%, if not the duty cycle is increased by 10%. Lastly, the timer interrupt service routines first check whether or not the interrupt was triggered on a rising or falling edge and enables or disable the LED accordingly.
