# Lab 4 part 2
The purpose of this code is to cycle the colors of an RGB LED using a pwm. First I had to declare a few variables for each of the pwms duty cycles and the led state. Then all of the pins that the LED are going to be hooked up to are set to outputs, cleared, and set for peripheral function with interrupts enabled. Next I had to setup the timer B3 which is used for the pwm. This timer is using the SMCLK in up mode. Then timer B0 is using the ACLK set to up mode with a divider of 4. It also has its interupt enabled. In the main function of the code all of the before mentioned functions are called and low power mode is enable for interrupts. Timer B0's interrupt service routine checks the state of the state of the led and cycles it to the next state by increasing the duty cycle of a certain color until the color has correctly changed. The port 6 interrupt checks the duty cycles of the pins and turns the individual color LEDs off if the duty cycle is 0.
